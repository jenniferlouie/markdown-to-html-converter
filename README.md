# Markdown Converter

The **Markdown Converter** is a responsive web-based tool designed to convert markdown text into HTML and formatted text. It allows users to input markdown text, view live-formatted results, and edit the HTML to see immediate updates to the formatted output. This tool is ideal for users who want to dynamically preview or edit markdown content and its corresponding HTML.

## Features

- **Markdown Input**: Paste your markdown text into the input box to instantly view the formatted output.
- **Formatted Text and HTML Output**: Toggle between different views — formatted text and HTML — to see real-time changes.
- **Editable HTML Output**: Modify the HTML directly in the output box to apply live updates to the formatted text.
- **Clear Function**: Clear the markdown input, which also clears the outputs for a fresh start.
- **Copy Functionality**: Copy the formatted text or HTML with dedicated copy buttons to use them elsewhere (e.g., in Google Docs, Word editors, or other websites).
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop use.

## How It Works

1. **Paste Markdown**: Add markdown text into the input box.
2. **View Outputs**: View the live result in two different formats:
    - Formatted Text
    - HTML
3. **Toggle Outputs**: Use the tabs (styled as radio buttons) to toggle between different views.
4. **Copy Outputs**: Use the copy buttons to grab the content from each of the two outputs.

## Usage

- **Clear**: Press the clear button to erase all inputs and reset the form.
- **Paste Markdown**: Paste your markdown in the input box and see live previews in the formatted text output.
- **Toggle Views**: Switch between formatted text and HTML to inspect or adjust the output.
- **Copy**: Use the copy buttons to copy the content for use in other projects or applications.
